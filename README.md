## 📖 Overview

This repository documents the deployment of a Windows Server 2025 enterprise laboratory environment designed to simulate a small corporate network.

The primary objective of the project was to gain practical experience with enterprise Windows infrastructure by deploying and configuring a centralized Active Directory environment from scratch.

The lab includes a fully functional domain controller, automatic network configuration through DHCP, internal DNS name resolution, centralized authentication using Active Directory, Group Policy management, file sharing with NTFS permissions, and Windows 11 domain clients.

Although this is a laboratory environment, the configuration follows many practices commonly used in small and medium-sized enterprise networks.

## 🏛️ Infrastructure Design

The laboratory environment simulates a centralized Windows Server infrastructure commonly found in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The deployment focuses on identity management, network services, centralized administration, and secure file sharing.

A single Windows Server 2025 virtual machine acts as the core infrastructure server and hosts multiple critical services. Two Windows 11 Pro virtual machines are joined to the Active Directory domain and function as managed client workstations.

The entire environment is isolated within an Oracle VirtualBox internal network, allowing enterprise technologies to be tested without requiring physical hardware or impacting the host operating system.

---

### Infrastructure Components

| Hostname | Operating System    | Role                                      |
| -------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| DC01     | Windows Server 2025 | Domain Controller, DNS, DHCP, File Server |
| CLIENT01 | Windows 11 Pro      | Domain Workstation                        |
| CLIENT02 | Windows 11 Pro      | Domain Workstation                        |

---

## 🚀 Deployment Workflow

The environment was deployed using the following sequence:

1. Installed Windows Server 2025
2. Configured static IP addressing
3. Installed Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
4. Promoted the server to a Domain Controller
5. Configured DNS services
6. Installed and configured DHCP Server
7. Created Active Directory Organizational Units
8. Created users and security groups
9. Joined Windows 11 clients to the domain
10. Configured Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
11. Configured file sharing and NTFS permissions
12. Tested authentication, DNS, DHCP, and permissions

    DC -->|Group Policy| C2

    DC -->|File Shares| C1
    DC -->|File Shares| C2
```

The Domain Controller provides all core infrastructure services for the laboratory environment. Windows 11 clients automatically receive network configuration from the DHCP server, resolve names through the DNS service, authenticate against Active Directory, receive Group Policy Objects (GPOs), and access centralized file shares.


---

### IP Addressing

| Device            | Address                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Domain Controller | 192.168.10.10                   |
| DNS Server        | 192.168.10.10                   |
| DHCP Server       | 192.168.10.10                   |
| Default Gateway   | Not configured                  |
| DHCP Scope        | 192.168.10.100 - 192.168.10.200 |

Clients automatically receive:

* IP Address
* Subnet Mask
* Preferred DNS Server
* Lease Time

using the DHCP service running on the Domain Controller.

## 🏢 Active Directory Structure

The Active Directory environment was organized using Organizational Units (OUs) to simplify administration and Group Policy deployment.

```text
Domain
│
└── Company
    │
    ├── Users
    │     ├── IT
    │     ├── HR
    │     └── Finance
    │
    ├── Groups
    │
    ├── Computers
    │
    └── Servers
```

This structure follows common enterprise administration practices by separating users, computers, and administrative objects into dedicated Organizational Units.

---

## 👥 User and Group Management

User accounts were created inside their respective Organizational Units and assigned to security groups according to their department.

Security groups are used to manage permissions instead of assigning permissions directly to users. This approach simplifies administration and follows Microsoft's recommended access control model.

Example departmental groups include:

| Group   | Purpose            |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| IT      | IT Department      |
| HR      | Human Resources    |
| Finance | Finance Department |

---

## 🔑 Authentication

Both Windows 11 clients were successfully joined to the Active Directory domain.

Domain authentication provides centralized identity management, allowing users to authenticate against the Domain Controller instead of maintaining separate local accounts on each workstation.

Benefits include:

* Centralized account management
* Single sign-on (SSO)
* Centralized password policies
* Group Policy enforcement
* Simplified administration

---

## 🔐 Security Configuration

Security configurations implemented:

* Password Policies
* Account Lockout Policies
* Least Privilege
* NTFS Access Control
* Share Permissions

---
